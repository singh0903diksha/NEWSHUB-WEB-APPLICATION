# NEWSHUB-WEB-APPLICATION
The News Hub project is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages the NewsAPI to fetch real-time news data based on user preferences and search queries. The application utilizes asynchronous JavaScript (via fetch API) to communicate with the NewsAPI(NEWSDATA.io) endpoints, retrieving JSON-formatted news articles.Upon receiving the data, the JavaScript code dynamically generates HTML elements to display the news content, encapsulated within individual news cards. These cards are structured to include key details such as article titles, images, sources, publication dates, and brief descriptions.Navigation options allow users to explore different news categories like politics,sports,finance seamlessly, while a search feature enables targeted content discovery.<br /> 
Overall, this project showcases the integration of front-end technologies to deliver a dynamic and interactive news browsing experience, offering users access to timely and relevant information.
